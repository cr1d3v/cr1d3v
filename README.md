## ♾️About

The sole purpose of my Github profile is to showcase my portfolio projects and provide an overview of what I am currently working on outside of work.

In short, I've been passionate about technology my entire life. I was in fact one of those overly curious children who would take things apart to figure out how they worked. That's exactly why to this day I continue to learn and develop in a forever evolving industry.
