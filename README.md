# üëã **Cristin Dohotaru**

**` Computer Science Graduate based in (Milton Keynes, UK)`**

An open-minded person committed to learning new concepts by overcoming obstacles through creative thinking.

I've been passionate about technology my entire life. I was in fact one of those overly curious children who would, take things apart to figure out how they worked, constantly brainstorming through my own thought process as I did so in an effort to challenge the status quo using effective research and concise communication methods.

My desire to understand how things function motivated me to pursue a career in technology and therefore convinced me to settle on a computer science degree, where upon completion I became a jack of all trades who is now looking to become the master of some.

Inbox me to chat, on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cristin-dohotaru/) or by [Email](mailto:cristin.dohotaru@gmail.com). We'll decide if working together makes sense!
