## ♾️ About

From tinkering with toys as a tot to diving deep into the digital domain as an adult, I’ve always had a curiosity for how things work: solving tech-related puzzles, dissecting concepts, and breaking problems into small, more manageable pieces to tackle. My whole life is a quest: spawned in the 90s, decoded my way through a Comp Sci degree, autosaved along the journey, moved across countries, meanwhile learned a few languages both spoken and programmed and constantly sought new milestones.

Building up my GitHub profile one thoughtful commit at a time :)
