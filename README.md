# üëã **Cristin Dohotaru**

**` Technology Craftsman based in the UK`**

An open-minded person committed to learning new concepts by overcoming obstacles through creative thinking.

I've been passionate about technology my entire life. I was in fact one of those overly curious children who would take things apart to figure out how they worked, constantly brainstorming through my own thought process as I did so in an effort to challenge the status quo using effective research and concise communication methods.

My desire to understand how things function motivated me to pursue a career in technology, which therefore convinced me to settle on a computer science degree. Upon graduation, I became a jack-of-all-trades who is currently working to become a master of some.
