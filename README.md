## ♾️About

#### From tinkering with toys as a tot to diving deep into the digital domain as an adult, I like spending my time solving tech-related puzzles, dissecting topics by breaking them down into small pieces. My whole life is a quest, spawned back in the 90s, decoded my way through a computer science degree, autosaved along the journey, moved across countries, learned a few languages and constantly sought new milestones.
